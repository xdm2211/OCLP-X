             <h1>OpenCore Legacy Patcher</h1>
</div>

- **English**
- [简体中文](./README_CN.md)

An officially modified version of a Python-based project revolving around [Acidanthera's OpenCorePkg](https://github.com/acidanthera/OpenCorePkg) and [Lilu](https://github.com/acidanthera/Lilu) for both running and unlocking features in macOS on supported and unsupported Macs.

Our project's main goal is to breathe new life into Macs no longer supported by Apple, allowing for the installation and usage of macOS Big Sur and newer on machines as old as 2007.

----------

Noteworthy features of OpenCore Legacy Patcher:

* Support for macOS Big Sur, Monterey, Ventura, Sonoma and Sequoia
* Native Over the Air (OTA) System Updates
* Supports Penryn and newer Macs
* Full support for WPA Wi-Fi and Personal Hotspot on BCM943224 and newer wireless chipsets
* System Integrity Protection, FileVault 2, .im4m Secure Boot and Vaulting
* Recovery OS, Safe Mode and Single-user Mode booting on non-native OSes
* Unlocks features such as Sidecar and AirPlay to Mac even on native Macs
* Enables enhanced SATA and NVMe power management on non-Apple storage devices
* Zero firmware patching required (ie. APFS ROM patching)
* Graphics acceleration for both Metal and non-Metal GPUs
* **Enhanced support for IntelWireless Cards on macOS Sequoia and macOS Tahoe 26(modified version supported)**  
* **Added support for Atheros WiFi cards and some legacy Broadcom WiFi card IDs(modified version supported)**
* **Added AppleHDA audio support (required by AppleALC) for macOS Tahoe 26 Beta 2 (26.0-25A5295e) and later.**

# How to Make Intel WiFi Work on macOS?

Thanks to [zxystd](https://github.com/zxystd) for his contribution! You need the Intel WiFi driver, which can be downloaded from his repository: [AirportItlwm](https://github.com/OpenIntelWireless/itlwm/releases).

## Intel WiFi Driver Methods

**Note:** You can only choose **one** of the two driver methods below, **they cannot be used simultaneously!**

### Method 1: Using [AirportItlwm](https://github.com/OpenIntelWireless/itlwm/releases)

1. **Ensure that all related drivers and patches from Method 2 have been completely removed.**

2. **For macOS High Sierra 10.13 ~ macOS Catalina 10.15**, in addition to using the AirportItlwm driver corresponding to your macOS version, you also need a Force patch.

   Add the following patch in **Kernel - Force**:

   | Identifier                           | BundlePath                                     | Comment                         | Enabled | ExecutablePath                  | PlistPath                  | MinKernel | MaxKernel | Arch |
   |--------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------|---------------------------------|---------|---------------------------------|--------------------------------|-----------|-----------|------|
   | com.apple.iokit.IO80211Family        | System/Library/Extensions/IO80211Family.kext | Force IO80211Family to load | true    | Contents/MacOS/IO80211Family | Contents/Info.plist          | 17.0.0    | 19.99.99  | Any  |

3. **For macOS Big Sur 11.0 ~ macOS Sonoma 14.x**, simply use the AirportItlwm driver corresponding to your macOS version.

   **Note:**  
   - If your system is macOS Sonoma 14.4 or later, use the **macOS Sonoma 14.4 AirportItlwm driver**.  
   - If your system is macOS Sonoma 14.0 ~ 14.3, use the **macOS Sonoma 14.0 AirportItlwm driver**.

4. **For macOS Sequoia 15**, there is currently no native AirportItlwm driver available (though it may be released in the future). The current solution is to use the **macOS Ventura AirportItlwm driver**.

   You may see **AirportItlwm_Sequoia.kext**, but it is essentially the Ventura driver renamed for better distinction. The following steps outline how to configure this driver for macOS Sequoia 15:

   - **Disable SIP (System Integrity Protection):** Set `csr-active-config` to `03080000` in **NVRAM-Add-7C436110-AB2A-4BBB-A880-FE41995C9F82** (or use `FF0F0000` to completely disable SIP).
   - **Disable AMFI (Apple Mobile File Integrity):** Set `amfi=0x80` in **NVRAM-Add-7C436110-AB2A-4BBB-A880-FE41995C9F82** or use **AMFIPass.kext v1.4.1 or later**.
   - **Set SecureBootModel to Disabled:** Navigate to **Misc -> Security -> SecureBootModel -> Disabled** in OpenCore.
   - **Disable FileVault:** Go to **System Settings > Privacy & Security > FileVault > Turn Off**.
   - **Add NVRAM delete entries**:

     Add the following under **NVRAM-Delete-7C436110-AB2A-4BBB-A880-FE41995C9F82**:
     - `boot-args`
     - `csr-active-config`
   
   - **Restart your Mac once to ensure the above changes take effect.**

   **Required Kext Drivers (Maintain the order as listed below):**

   | BundlePath                        | Comment       | Enabled | ExecutablePath                      | PlistPath                  | MinKernel | MaxKernel | Arch |
   |-----------------------------------|--------------|---------|--------------------------------------|----------------------------|-----------|-----------|------|
   | IOSkywalkFamily.kext              | V1.0         | true    | Contents/MacOS/IOSkywalkFamily      | Contents/Info.plist        | 24.0.0    | 24.99.99  | Any  |
   | IO80211FamilyLegacy.kext          | V1200.12.2b1 | true    | Contents/MacOS/IO80211FamilyLegacy  | Contents/Info.plist        | 24.0.0    | 24.99.99  | Any  |
   | AirportItlwm_Sequoia.kext         | V2.3.0       | true    | Contents/MacOS/AirportItlwm         | Contents/Info.plist        | 24.0.0    | 24.99.99  | Any  |


## Note:

   1. **AirportItlwm_Sequoia.kext** is just the **Ventura** version of the **AirportItlwm** driver with a renamed file! 
   
   2. The mentioned **IOSkywalkFamily.kext** and **IO80211FamilyLegacy.kext** can be obtained from the repository [IOSkywalkFamily & IO80211FamilyLegacy](https://github.com/JeoJay127/OCLP-X/tree/main/payloads/Kexts/Wifi).


   **Add the following patch in Kernel - Block:**

   | Identifier                           | Comment                 | Enabled | Strategy | MinKernel | MaxKernel | Arch |
   |--------------------------------------|-------------------------|---------|----------|-----------|-----------|------|
   | com.apple.iokit.IOSkywalkFamily      |                         | true    | Exclude  | 24.0.0    |           | Any  |

   **Finally, download this modified version of OpenCore Legacy Patcher, run it, and apply Root Patching:**
   - Click **Post-Install Root Patch** -> **Start Root Patching**, then restart your Mac.

### Method 2: Using [HeliPort](https://github.com/OpenIntelWireless/HeliPort/releases) + [Itlwm](https://github.com/OpenIntelWireless/itlwm/releases)

1. **Ensure that all related drivers and patches from Method 1 have been completely removed.**

2. **Add the Itlwm driver and install the HeliPort client.**

   **Note:** The unrestricted version of **HeliPort + Itlwm** supports **macOS High Sierra 10.13 ~ macOS Sequoia 15**.

## Intel Bluetooth on macOS Ventura and newer

### Recommendations:
- **Ensure your USB ports are properly mapped.**
- **Modify NVRAM settings** by adding the following entries in **NVRAM-Add-7C436110-AB2A-4BBB-A880-FE41995C9F82**:

   | Key                              | Type  | Value                          |
   |----------------------------------|------|--------------------------------|
   | bluetoothExternalDongleFailed   | Data | 00                             |
   | bluetoothInternalControllerInfo | Data | 0000000000000000000000000000   |

   **Alternative (e.g., for Intel AX201, AX200 wireless cards):**

   | Key                              | Type  | Value                          |
   |----------------------------------|------|--------------------------------|
   | bluetoothExternalDongleFailed   | Data | 00                             |
   | bluetoothInternalControllerInfo | Data | 000000000000000089653A552EFD   |
